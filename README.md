# Reuben Diaz

Chicago-based. He/him pronouns. The only person on Earth who actually *likes* Java.

Currently moving a few personal projects from GitLab to GitHub, so that other folks
can see what I've been working on in my free time. That said, I still do all my actual
development on GitLab. I prefer to use Free/Libre Software whenever I can.
